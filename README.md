# Shape Editor

ShapeEditor is a JavaFX desktop application that allows users to create and manipulate various shapes, such as rectangles, lines, and ovals. The user can customize the shapes by choosing different colors and fill styles (filled or unfilled).  They can also group multiple shapes together, copy existing shapes, delete unwanted shapes, or clear the entire canvas. The application also provides the functionality to save the file and load it later for further editing.

The code sample includes several classes that handle different aspects of the desktop application. ShapeCanvas class manages the canvas and the shapes drawn on it and provides methods to add, remove, and manipulate shapes. The Edit abstract class allows various editing functions, like drawing, deleting, moving, and copying shapes, along with the undo and redo functionality. Classes like DrawEdit, DeleteEdit, MoveEdit, and CopyEdit extend the Edit class and implement the edit operation.

Therefore, the code sample represents the core functionality of a shape editor application that allows users to create and edit different shapes, group them, copy, delete, and manage the canvas state through save and load options.
